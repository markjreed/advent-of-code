# 2022

This year I'm solving first in [Raku](https://raku.org/), then as time and LoE
permits, adding solutions in other languages, starting with
[APL](https://tryapl.org) and Commodore BASIC targeting the [Commander
X-16](https://commanderx16.com), along with another language for that platform,
[Prog8](https://prog8.readthedocs.io).

I usually toss in a [Python](https://python.org) solution, too, for comparison
with the many other folks solving in that language.
