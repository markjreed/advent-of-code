Rock/Paper/Scissors (Roshambo) matchups, numerified

"Rock, Paper, Scissors" is in losing order; that is, Rock loses to Paper loses
to Scissors (loses to Rock). If we assign the shapes in that order to three
consecutive integers and enumerate the possibilities, it's easy to see that the
desired score is just 3 times the value (Human - Elf + 1) mod 3:

Elf       Human     Winner  (Human - Elf + 1) % 3
Rock      Rock      Tie     1
Rock      Paper     Human   2
Rock      Scissors  Elf     0

Paper     Rock      Elf     0
Paper     Paper     Tie     1
Paper     Scissors  Human   2

Scissors  Rock      Human   2
Scissors  Paper     Elf     0
Scissors  Scissors  Tie     1

For the final score we also want to add 1 when the human player played rock, 2
for paper, and 3 for scissors. So if we use 1 to 3 as our integer values for
the shapes, then the score for a given matchup in part 1 is this:

		Part1: E=Elf play (A=1,B=2,C=3), H=Human play (X=1,Y=2,Z=3): 
		       Score = H + (H - E + 1) % 3 × 3

In part two the human code is not a shape but a goal: the desired match result.
We need to use the Elf's play and the goal to derive the human's play.
If we enumerate the possibilities again, we can see that the desired shape
is the one whose value is (Elf + Goal) mod 3 + 1:

Elf          Goal      Play         (Elf + Goal) % 3 + 1
Rock(1)      Lose(1)   Scissors(3)  3
Rock(1)      Tie(2)    Rock(1)      1
Rock(1)      Win(3)    Paper(2)     2

Paper(2)     Lose(1)   Rock(1)      1
Paper(2)     Tie(2)    Paper(2)     2
Paper(2)     Win(3)    Scissors(3)  3

Scissors(3)  Lose(1)   Paper(2)     2
Scissors(3)  Tie(2)    Scissors(3)  3
Scissors(3)  Win(3)    Rock(1)      1

The match result is given to us directly with 0 for X, 3 for Y, and 6 for Z. 
So if we keep the assignment of numeric values the same for consistency:

		Part2: E=Elf play (A=1,B=2,C=3), H=Human goal (X=1,Y=2,Z=3): 
		       Score = 3 × (H - 1) + (E + H) % 3 + 1
