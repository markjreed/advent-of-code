# Day 6
Today I found myself AFK with only my phone, so I solved the puzzles in MyLisp for iOS, which was
interesting - copying and pasting data from the browser into the REPL, building a bunch of stock
functions from scratch. When I got back to a computer I transcribed the solution from MyLisp and also
translated the solution to both Common Lisp and Scheme (and of course Raku).

| Filenames | Description
