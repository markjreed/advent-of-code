# 2015 Day 17 Solution
The randomly-chosen language for today is Raku (formerly Perl 6). This is
my go-to language for day-to-day personal scripting, and it's insanely
powerful, so this was pretty much a no-brainer: 5 lines of code.

To run: `raku day17.raku input.txt`.  It takes an optional second argument
specifying the volume to try to match, which defaults to the 150 required by
the problem. To run the example from the problem description, use `raku
day17.raku sample.txt 25`. 

|File|Description
|---|--------|
|[day17.raku](day17.raku)     | Solution |
|[sample.txt](sample.txt) | Sample input from the problem description |
|[input.txt](input.txt)   | My program input (encrypted) |
