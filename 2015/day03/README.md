# 2015 Day 3 Solution
Randomly-chosen language for today: Bash, the GNU Bourne-Again Shell.

My solution takes advantage of associative arrays, which were introduced in
version 4; the /bin/bash shipped on macOS is still version 3, so you will need
a newer version (available via e.g. Homebrew) to run it.

To run: `bash day3.sh input.txt`.
