# Going back

2015 was the first Advent of Code. I didn't discover it until 5 years later,
but after completing 2024 (my first 50-star year), I decided to go back to the
beginning (like Vizzini said). 

I'm going to try solving each day in a randomly-selected programming language
(selected from the list of languages that have solutions in my [Foxtrot
collection](https://mjnr.us/foxtrot/)).

Solutions so far:
|Day|Language
|---|--------|
| [1](day01/README.md)  |Postscript        |
| [2](day02/README.md)  |Prolog            |
| [3](day03/README.md)  |Bourne-Again Shell|
| [4](day04/README.md)  |Ruby              |
| [5](day05/README.md)  |APL               |
| [6](day06/README.md)  |Python            |
| [7](day07/README.md)  |Logo              |
| [8](day08/README.md)  |PHP               |
| [9](day09/README.md)  |SNOBOL            |
| [10](day10/README.md) |Pascal            |
