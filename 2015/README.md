# Going back

2015 was the first Advent of Code. I didn't discover it until 5 years later,
but after completing 2024 (my first 50-star year), I decided to go back to the
beginning (like Vizzini said). 

I'm going to try solving each day in a randomly-selected programming language
(selected from the list of languages that have solutions in my [Foxtrot
collection](https://mjnr.us/foxtrot/)).
