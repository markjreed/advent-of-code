# 2015 Day 12 Solution
The randomly-chosen language for today is Scheme. This is clearly to counter
yesterday's good luck choosing Perl; all things being equal, Scheme would not
be my first choice for parsing JSON. Still, onward. I chose Chicken Scheme,
for which there's a JSON-parsing module called `medea`.

To run: `csc -o day12 day12.scm && ./day12 input.txt`.
